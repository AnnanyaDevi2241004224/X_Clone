# X_Clone
## Introduction

**X_Clone** is a basic front-end clone of the popular social media platform, X (formerly Twitter). This project was created to showcase my skills in front-end web development using HTML5 and Tailwind CSS. The clone replicates the layout and basic design elements of the platform, providing a responsive and modern user interface.
